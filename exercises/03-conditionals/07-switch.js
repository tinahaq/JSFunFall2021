let monthNum = "10"; // e.g.

/**
 * You are going to convert a month in its number form (e.g. 1 or "01")
 * into the month as text.
 * "monthNum" represents the given month as a number.
 * Create a variable called "monthText".
 * It should convert "monthNum" into the month as text.
 * If you cannot convert "monthNum" into text, than "monthNum" should be null.
 *
 * @example
 * If "monthNum" is "03", then "monthText" should be "March".
 * If "monthNum" is "12", then "monthText" should be "December".
 * If "monthNum" equals anything else, then "monthText" should be null.
 *
 * You must use a switch statement to solve this problem.
